Perfect - Ed Sheeran

I found a love for me 
Oh darling,just drive right in in and follow my lead
Well,i found a girl,beautiful and sweet
Oh,i never knew you were the someone waiting for me 
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love 
Not knowing what it was 
I will not give you up this time 
But darling,just kiss me slow,your heart is all i own 
And in your eyes,you're holding mine

'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was 
I will not give you up this time 

But darling,just kiss me slow,your heart is all i own 
And in your eyes,yo;re holding mine 

Baby,I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms 
Barefoot on the grass,listening to our favourite song 
When you said you looked a mess,I whispered underneath my breath 
But you heard it,darling,you look perfect tonight 

Well i found a woman,stronger than anyone i know 
She sahres my dreams,I hope that someday i'll share her  home 
I found a love,to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love,to carry children of our own
