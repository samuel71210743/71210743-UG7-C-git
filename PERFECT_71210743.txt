Perfect - Ed Sheeran

I found a love for me 
Oh darling,just drive right in in and follow my lead
Well,i found a girl,beautiful and sweet
Oh,i never knew you were the someone waiting for me 
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love 
Not knowing what it was 
I will not give you up this time 
But darling,just kiss me slow,your heart is all i own 
And in your eyes,you're holding mine
Baby,I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms 
Barefoot on the grass,listening to our favourite song 
When you said you looked a mess,i whispered underneath my breath 
But you heard it,darling,you look perfect tonight
